# PRINT_SCRYPT
Print prescriptions located inside a folder with patient's complete name.

Create a folder. Name it with the same name of your patient. Inside this folder, place all the prescriptions in PDF format you want to store for printing in the future. Every time you excecute the Script (after compilation), you will be asked for patient's complete name and how many copies of each prescription you want to print.
